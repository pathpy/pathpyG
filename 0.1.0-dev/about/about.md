## What is pathpyG?

pathpyG is an Open Source package facilitating GPU-accelerated next-generation network analytics and graph learning for time series data on graphs.

pathpyG is tailored to analyse time-stamped network data as well as sequential data that capture multiple short walks or paths observed in a graph or network. Examples for data that can be analysed with pathpyG include high-resolution time-stamped network data, dynamic social networks, user click streams on the Web, biological pathway data, directed acyclic graphs like citation networks, passenger trajectories in transportation networks, or trajectories of information propagation in social networks.

pathpyG is fully integrated with jupyter, providing rich interactive visualisations of networks, temporal networks, and higher-order models. Visualisations can be exported to HTML5 files that can be shared and published on the Web.
