The DevContainer that is part of our GitHub Repository on the other hand already has all of the necessary dependencies installed. \n",

    "This first step of our multi-stage introductory tutorial introduces key concepts of `pathpyG`. While `pathpyG` targets GPU-accelerated analysis and learning using higher-order graph models for time series data on graphs, it can also be used to represent, analyze and interactively visualize static graphs. For this, it provides a `Graph` class that is build around the `torch_geometric.data.Data` object, which has the advantage that we can directly apply `pyG` transforms and use the `Graph` object for deep graph learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial you will learn how we can use `pathpyG` to represent static graphs. We start with basic features to create directed and undirected graphs with node-, edge-, and graph-level attributes. We also show how we can read and write graph data and how we can implement graph algorithms that are based on a traversal of nodes and edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "We first import the modules `torch`, `torch_geometric` and `pathpyG`. By setting the device used by `torch`, we specify whether we want to run our code on the CPU or on the GPU. For a CPU-based execution, set the `torch.device` configuration to `cpu`. Set the device to `cuda` if you want to run it on the GPU instead."
