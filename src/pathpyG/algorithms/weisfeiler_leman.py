    """Run Weisfeiler-Leman isomorphism test on two graphs.
    
    The algorithm heuristically checks whether two graphs are isomorphic. If it returns False,
    we can be sure that the graphs are non-isomoprhic. If the test returns True we did not find
    conclusive evidence that they are not isomorphic, i.e. the graphs may or may not be isomophic.

    The two graphs must have IndexMap mappings that assign different node IDs to the nodes
    in both graphs. The function will raise an error if the node labels of both graphs overlap.

    The function returns a tuple (bool, list, list), where the first entry is the result of the test
    and the two lists represent the fingerprints of the two graphs. If the test yields true the fingerprints
    are identical. If the test fails, the fingerprints do not correspond.
