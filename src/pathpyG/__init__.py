"""pathpyG is an Open Source package facilitating next-generation network analytics and
graph learning for time series data on graphs.

Building on the industry-proven data structures and concepts of `pytorch`
and `torch_geometric`, pathpyG makes it easier than ever to apply machine learning
to temporal graph data.

pathpyG is jointly developed at University of Wuerzburg, Princeton University,
and University of Zurich. The research behind pathpyG has been funded by the
Swiss National Science Foundation via 
[grant 176938](https://data.snf.ch/grants/grant/176938).
