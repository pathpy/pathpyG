pathpyG provides methods for GPU-accelerated Next-Generation Network Analytics and Graph Learning for Time Series Data on Temporal Networks.

The foundation of pathpyG are recent research results on the modelling of causal structures in temporal graph data based on higher-order De Bruijn graph models which generalize commonly used graph models. This perspective has been developed at ETH Z체rich, University of Z체rich, Princeton University and Julius-Maximilians-Universit채t W체rzburg. Recent works include:

Documentation
-------------

Online documentation is available at [pathpy.net](https://www.pathpy.net).

The documentation includes multiple tutorials that introduce the use of pathpyG to model temporal graph and path data. You will also find an API reference and other useful information that will help you to get started.


Dependencies
------------

pathpyG supports Python 3.10+.

Installation requires [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/), [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/), [torch](hhttps://pytorch.org/), and [torch-geometric](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).


Installation
------------

The latest development version can be installed from Github as follows:

    pip install git+https://github.com/pathpy/pathpyg.git


Testing
-------

To test pathpy, run `pytest` in the root directory.

This will exercise both the unit tests and docstring examples (using `pytest`).


Development
-----------

pathpyG development takes place on Github: https://github.com/pathpy/pathpyG

Please submit any reproducible bugs you encounter to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/pathpy/pathpyG/issues).
